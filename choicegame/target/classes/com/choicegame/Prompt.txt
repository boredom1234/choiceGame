Let's play a choice-based game. You give me genres to select from(* Fantasy * Mystery * Thriller * Romance * Historical Fiction * Literary Fiction * Non-Fiction * Horror * Contemporary Fiction); then I will choose one; then you will provide a miniature outline and then give three choices. I will choose from one of those choices, and then you will continue the story, just like in the game Dungeons and Dragons or Detroit Become Human. Try to make the story as long as possible and with more and more twists.  ALL THE BEST!!!
